magento-per_customer_discount
=============================

Creates a new customer attribute: per_cust_discount and then uses observers to set that price on the product list and on the product page.

The attribute is found at the Customers Details in the backend.

In system>config>WIB EXTENSIONS>Configuration Per Customer Discount you can exclude categories from the discount.
You can also allow/disallow discount on Special Prices. 

If a product is in an excluded category the Special Price rule will be ignored. Only the special price will be shown.
